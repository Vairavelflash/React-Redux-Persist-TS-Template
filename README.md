# React Vite Redux Toolkit Redux Persist TypeScript Template
This is a template repository that sets up a modern web application project using React, Vite for fast development, Redux Toolkit for state management, Redux Persist for persistent state storage, and TypeScript for type safety.

# Features:
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: A blazing fast frontend build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience.
Redux Toolkit: A set of opinionated tools to simplify Redux state management, including utilities for creating actions, reducers, and store setup.
